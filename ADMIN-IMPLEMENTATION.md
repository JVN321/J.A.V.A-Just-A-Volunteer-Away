## üìÅ Files Modified

### Database Schema (`src/main/resources/sql/schema.sql`)
```sql
-- Updated role comment
role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'ELDERLY', 'VOLUNTEER', or 'ADMIN'

-- Added admin user
INSERT INTO users (username, password, email, first_name, last_name, phone_number, role, date_of_birth) 
VALUES ('admin', 'admin123', 'admin@volunteer.com', 'System', 'Administrator', '555-0000', 'ADMIN', '1990-01-01');
```

### User Model (`User.java`)
```java
// Added fields
private boolean isActive; // For account status tracking

// Added methods
public boolean isActive() { return isActive; }
public void setActive(boolean isActive) { this.isActive = isActive; }
```

### Database Manager (`DatabaseManager.java`)
Added 8 new admin methods:
1. `getAllUsers()` - Fetch all users with status
2. `getAllTasks()` - Fetch all tasks
3. `toggleUserStatus(userId, isActive)` - Enable/disable accounts
4. `cancelUserActiveTasks(userId)` - Cancel tasks when user disabled
5. `adminDeleteTask(taskId)` - Force delete any task
6. `getTaskHistory()` - Retrieve activity log
7. `addTaskHistory(...)` - Log task changes
8. `getSystemStats()` - Get platform statistics

### GUI (`VolunteerGUI.java`)
Added admin panel components:
- `ADMIN_PANEL` constant
- `createAdminPanel()` - Main admin dashboard

- `showAllUsers()` - User table dialog
- `showAllTasks()` - Task table dialog
- `showTaskHistory()` - History log dialog
